## Semantic Information Pursuit for Multimodal Data Analysis ([MURI](http://vision.jhu.edu/infopursuit/))

### About

In 1948 Shanon laid the foundations of information theory which
revolutionized statistics, physics, engineering, and computer science. A strong
limitation, however, is that the semantic content of data is not taken into
account. This research will produce a novel framework for characterizing
semantic information content in multimodal data. It will combine non-convex
optimization with advanced statistical methods, leading to new representation
learning algorithms, measures of uncertainty, and sampling methods. Given data
from a scene, the algorithms will be able find the most informative
representations of the data for a specific task. These methods will be applied
to complex datasets from real situations, including text, images, videos, sensor
signals, and cameras, resulting in intelligent decision based algorithms.

### Current work

Our group is working on characertizing uncertainty in multimodal
representations. We will develop a statistical framework for characterizing the
uncertainty of the information representations using both frequentists and
Bayesian approaches. We will also develop efficient statistical sampling
methods, which will be useful for both characterizing uncertainty and performing
inference in the information pursuit framework.
